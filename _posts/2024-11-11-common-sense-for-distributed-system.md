## Introduction 

This is a note for some basic concepts in distributed system.

## RPC

- Calls a procedure at a different address space
- Transfer of both control and data across a communication network

### Key Points

- stubs: automatically generated by a program called lupine
from interface module
  - An interface module is a list of procedure calls together with the types of their arguments and results
  - Today, we call this “interface module” interface description and the corresponding language, interface description language, e.g., protobuf

- Binding: Check to make sure that the procedure descriptions match
between the client and the server
