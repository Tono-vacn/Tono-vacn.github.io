---

My name is Yucehn Jiang. I am now a second year master student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (SDE Track) at Duke University. I'm now looking for a new grad software engineer position. I have experience in web development, mobile development, frontend development and backend development. 

And here is something I haven't mentioned on my resume:

- My favorite music genres are mid-west emo, shoegaze, math rock, and post-rock.
- I'm quite confident in my cooking skills, especially in **authentic** Chinese cuisine (eastern China style).
- Biking is my first choice of transportation since my high school.
- I'm also a sub-culture enthusiast, I love to watch anime, read manga, but not very good at playing games.

<!-- ### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
